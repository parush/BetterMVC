==========

An opinionated ASP.NET MVC project template

In which I take the default ASP.NET MVC template and make it better.

## What does better mean?

  * More testable and maintainable

  * Easier to navigate and works well with distributed source control
 
## Features

* Service Layer with Service-Per-Resource and DTOs
* Partial classes for controllers and services
* Entity Framework Which works with Git / HG Branching
* Improved Scaffolding for Service Methods, DTOs and Controllers
* Dependency Injection
* Integration Tests, Seeds, and Unit Tests
